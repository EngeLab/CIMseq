v0.2.0.3
* adding getCellsForMultiplet function
* fixing CIMseqSwarm concatenation function

v0.2.0.2
* fixing CIMseqSwarm show methods so tibbles do not show as lists
* adding adjustFractions function
* adding cellNumberPerClass function
* adding checks for classification and dim.red slots in CIMseqSinglets objects
* removing calculation for cellNumberMin and cellNumberMax from estimateCells function
* estimateCells function now correctly only uses singlets for estimatedCellNumber calculation
* renaming spSwarmPoisson to calculateEdgeStats and re-writing to use adjusted fractions
* updated p-value calculation
* getEdgesForMultiplet now returns edges in both directions
* better defaults for getEdgesForMultiplet and appropriateSinglets
* Adding circos plot and accessory functions

v.0.2.0.1
* adding concatenate function for CIMseqSwarm objects
* CIMseqSwarm arguments slot now a tibble

v0.2.0.0
* removed spUnsupervised. Classification, dim.red, and features now user provided.
* lots of renaming of classes, etc. and even the package. See updated vignette for workflow

v0.1.0.2
* spUnsupervised now uses kNN classification.

v0.1.0.1
* spCounts now does not store counts.cpm or counts.log and, instead, computes them when requested.
* testData is updated to use real data from the countsSorted2 dataset
* The syntheticMultiplets spSwarm obj slot now holds the indices of the singlets used to synthesise synthetic multiplets instead of the subsetted singlets (lower weight).
* Furthermore, the above named slot has been renamed to 'singletIdx'.
* unit tests updated accordingly for above changes

v0.1.0.0
* Deconvolution also now using poisson method. Old method moved to legacy branch.

v0.0.2.0
* Change in spSwarmPoisson that causes the edges to only be calculated for uniquely named cell types (unsure if this is a great idea or not but doing it for now).

v0.0.1.9
* Fixed bug in complexityPenalty where multiplets with a cell number < 1 gave negative residuals
* Updated calcResiduals to work with dtsnCellNum although it is not tested with other distance functions

v0.0.1.8
* Added countsPerClass function.

v0.0.1.7
* adding calculateCost function (may remove later)
* fixed apparent bug in spSwarmPoisson .calculateWeight unit

v0.0.1.6
* Issue #46: Improved performance by using matrixStats package for spUnsupervised
* Issue #47: Improved performance of spCounts.

v0.0.1.5
* Issue #45: NAs in ERCC problem with convertToERCC function

v0.0.1.4
* Issue #41: NAs in ERCC problem with estimateCells function
* Fixing badges
* Adding unit tests

v0.0.1.3
* Plots reworked to have more managable code and facilitate users gaining access to plot data to make custom plots.
* Added plotting vignette to describe plotting features.
* tidy functions added for spUnsupervised and spSwarm objects.
* Several new input checks.
* Added codecov functionality.
* Added structure for revdep, although this is not presently functional.
* Updated travis to build with release and devel.
* Default edge.cutoff value for spSwarmPoission now 0.
* Dataset docs for test dataset now in one file.
* Test data samples now have unique names (colnames).
* Added matrix_to_tibble and normalizeVec functions, mostly for internal use.
* README now generated via README.Rmd
* Unit tests updated accordingly, although there is still some work to be done here.

v0.0.1.2
* Adding alternative color schemes for plotUnsupervised markers plot.
* Adding warning for estimateCells when samples exist with ERCC counts that are all 0.
  Prevents NaN.
