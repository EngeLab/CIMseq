v0.0.2.0
* Change in spSwarmPoisson that causes the edges to only be calculated for uniquely named cell types (unsure if this is a great idea or not but doing it for now).

v0.0.1.9
* Fixed bug in complexityPenalty where multiplets with a cell number < 1 gave negative residuals
* Updated calcResiduals to work with dtsnCellNum although it is not tested with other distance functions

v0.0.1.8
* Added countsPerClass function.

v0.0.1.7
* adding calculateCost function (may remove later)
* fixed apparent bug in spSwarmPoisson .calculateWeight unit

v0.0.1.6
* Issue #46: Improved performance by using matrixStats package for spUnsupervised
* Issue #47: Improved performance of spCounts.

v0.0.1.5
* Issue #45: NAs in ERCC problem with convertToERCC function

v0.0.1.4
* Issue #41: NAs in ERCC problem with estimateCells function
* Fixing badges
* Adding unit tests

v0.0.1.3
* Plots reworked to have more managable code and facilitate users gaining access to plot data to make custom plots.
* Added plotting vignette to describe plotting features.
* tidy functions added for spUnsupervised and spSwarm objects.
* Several new input checks.
* Added codecov functionality.
* Added structure for revdep, although this is not presently functional.
* Updated travis to build with release and devel.
* Default edge.cutoff value for spSwarmPoission now 0.
* Dataset docs for test dataset now in one file.
* Test data samples now have unique names (colnames).
* Added matrix_to_tibble and normalizeVec functions, mostly for internal use.
* README now generated via README.Rmd
* Unit tests updated accordingly, although there is still some work to be done here.
* Adding alternative color schemes for plotUnsupervised markers plot.
* Adding warning for estimateCells when samples exist with ERCC counts that are all 0.
  Prevents NaN.
