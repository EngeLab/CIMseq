\usage{
multipletSumsEigen(singlets)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjusted}{matrix; A counts matrix with cells/samples as columns and 
genes as rows. This matrix should have been previously subset with the 
\link{\code{sampleSinglets}} and \code{subsetSingletsEigen} functions so that
only one singlet per class/cell type is present. Furthermore, it should have
already been asjusted by the fractions using the 
\link{\code{adjustAccordingToFractionsEigen}} function.}
}
